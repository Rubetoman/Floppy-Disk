# Floppy Disk 1.2

## About
-------------
Floppy Disk is a clone of the famous game Flappy Bird. It was developed by Rubén Crispín in one week as a learning project. The main goal was to learn how to create Unity builds for mobile as well as using post processing effects.

Desired resolution (some UI elements might not look as intended):
- On phone is 640x920.
- On PC is 1920x1080.

The project was saved with Unity 2018.3.9f1.

## How to play
-------------
To play just tap the screen or use mouse click on PC. Each tap/click will make the floppy disk go higher.
- If the floppy disk touches the ground or any column the game will end.
- Each column passed adds one point to the score.
- Each time you hit retry the song played will change.

### Options:
-------------
From the options screen you can change the audio and sound effects volume as well as some graphic options.

### Post Processing Options
There are two dropdowns that lets you change the type of Post Processing profiles and filters.

#### Post Processing profiles
- TV: It will apply some chromatic aberration, grain and TV like vignette to simulate an old TV resolution.
- Green: It will turn all colors to green and a vignette, making the image similar to the one obtained by old mobile phones.
- Black and White: It will turn all colors to black and white and a vignette simulating a no color TV.
- Vaporwave: The colors will change over time giving the impression of being on drugs.

#### Post Processing filters
- VHS: It will add a noise and scrolling lines similar to the ones given by a VHS.
- Pixelated: It will pixelate the image to give the impression of an old-school videogame.


### Leaderboard:
-------------
After ending a game you can save the score to the leaderboard.
- Just use the input text element below the score to introduce your name and press "Enter".

In the Leaderboards screen you can scroll to see all the scores saved:
- By clicking on the score button the list is sorted from highest to lowest score.
